She takes care of my baby sister Meg, 
who is only three months old. My sister is very small and funny. She sleeps, 
eats and sometimes cries. We all help our mother and let her have a rest in the
evening. Then she usually reads a book or just watches TV. My father is a doctor.
He is tall and handsome. He has short dark hair and gray eyes. He is a very 
hardworking man. He is rather strict with us, but always fair. 

My elder brother Ken is thirteen, and he is very clever. He is good at Maths and 
always helps me with it, because I can hardly understand all these sums and 
problems. Ken has red hair and brown eyes. My name is Jessica. I am eleven. I have
long dark hair and brown eyes. I am not as clever as my brother, though I try to do 
my best at school too. I am fond of dancing. Our dancing studio won The Best 
Dancing Studio 2015 competition last month. I am very proud of it. I also like to 
help my mother with my little sister very much. Our family is very united. We love 
each other and always try to spend more time together.
